I completely agree with this statement. It is when student's take it upon themselves to figure out how to do something that they will gain knowledge. Along with this knowledge student's are also able to get a better understanding of themselves and the ethical reasoning behind remaining academically honest. I have noticed in my experience that by remaining honest not only to the school but with myself, I understand material better and am able to feel responsible for my work as I know it is my own.
