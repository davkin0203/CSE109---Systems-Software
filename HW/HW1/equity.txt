It is important to treat everybody fairly because you want to be treated the way you treat other people; therefore, by being nice to people, they will also be nice to you. And by being respectful to people, they will also hopefully pass that on by being nice to other's around them. This would make a world of good people who are all nice to each other. It is once we all can participate in this demonstration of respect then we will have a society where thinking of your self doesn't come first and everyone's looking out for their neighbors. This can be seen in sports teams where everybody has each other's backs, that is what society would look like.
