swap1
  a) it is passing in a copy of the variables but not the address of the variables. This means that 
     the actually memory is not being altered, the values are temporarily being swapped
  b) the program did not swap the variables because it just passed in copies of the variables into the function 
     but the memory address stays unchanged

swap2
  a) the memory addresses are being passed into the function swap
  b) the values of x and y did not swap because the copies of the addresses were passed into the function but 
     not the actual memory addresses of x and y 

swap3
  a) the pointers of x and y are being passed into the function swap 
  b) the values of x and y did not swap because x and y were initilized as pointers with integer values instead
     of just variables and then passing in the pointers of the values

swap4
  a) the memory addresses of x and y were passed into the function swap
  b) the values did swap because the memory addresses were passed into the function and then the pointers of 
     the values were swapped within the function
